# DePacinoFaceClassifier
This is a project aiming to differentiate between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro

To run it, you should first make two folders.
1. images
2. finalImages

Put all the required images in the 'images' folder, and run the ML/faceDetection.py after installing the dependecies. 

In order to scrape the data. You need to have another folder called 
imgs

then you need to run the scrapingCode, however, make sure to change the variable appropriately. and note the page= at the end, that should be kept the way it is, so that it does iterate through the pages.
